# To do list
-   Center 3D plots w.r.t objects.
-   Double check landing threshold estimation algorithm (VVHL5 plots had merged objects).
-   Modify sphere detection (fit a sphere based on walking trajectories).
-   Modify noisy trajectory filtering to use landed data instead of all data.
-   Smoothen trajectories using a Kalman filter?


# Completed
-   Automatically decide landing threshold for every trial.
-   Filter noisy trajectories based on velocities.
